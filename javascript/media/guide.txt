working with media queries

In General, we usually start with a range of three or four breakpoints that cover widths from
mobile up through large screens.

Let's say that you set breakpoint at 43em(688px), 62em(992px), and 82em(1312px) wide.
You know that phones will all be under 688px, most tablets will fall somewhere between 688px and 992px
, smaller screens will be between 992px to 1312px, and larger screens will be greater than 1312px.


max-width = longer than or higher than
min-width = shorter than or lower than
