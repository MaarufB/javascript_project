1. Sketch out how the layout will look on mobile, tablet, and desktop
2. Start coding the basic layout, using semantic HTML and CSS
3. Going section by section, build the rest of the layout
4. In your CSS, follow a mobile-first approach, creating the styles for the smallest
    width, then progressively greater widths.


* Stacking is the most basic way to fit content efficiently onto a narrow device like a mobile phone
